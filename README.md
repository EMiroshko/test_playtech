This test task is completed with using http://www.flickr.com/services/api/
Cause of flickr services returns not a JSON object but function `jsonFlickrApi`. So I use eval() to get clear JSON.

How it works

You can use this form for searching photos and images that you need by tags. You can add any picture to your gallery.
To do that you need to hover on image, then click on appeared "Click here to add this image to your gallery".
Please pay attention that you can not add the same image two times.
You can see your added images in your Gallery. Please click to "Show my gallery" to be sure in this.

And good luck!
